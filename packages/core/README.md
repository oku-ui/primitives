## Thanks

Thanks to [@radix_ui](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives) for the inspiration and the great work they've done with [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com). We proceed through the initial stages of many codes by looking at them.

Thanks to Johnson Chu [@johnsoncodehk](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk). Supported me with many issues that I was stuck in Typescript.

Thanks to Daniel Roe [@danielroe](https://github.com/danielroe). Nuxt has helped me in many areas so far.
