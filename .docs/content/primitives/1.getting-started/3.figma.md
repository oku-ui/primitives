## Features
- 22+ Components
- Dark/Light mode options
- Twitter Covers

## We Opened Our Designs to Everyone
We've decided to open the designs of our currently available components to the public. [Here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1287361241251561588/oku-ui-primitives) you can access our figma file and check out our designs. The file contains many designs other than component designs.

### Easily Stylable Components
When creating a component, we took care to make the naming meaningful, so you can find what you are looking for without any difficulty when making a change.

### Dark/Light Mode Options
Our components have 2 color modes, dark and light. And they can be easily changed via figma.

### Twitter Covers & Open Graph Images
The file also contains cover images and open-graph images for Twitter posts.
